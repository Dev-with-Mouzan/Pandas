# Pandas Data Analysis Practice

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating various data analysis and manipulation techniques using **Pandas**. The practice exercises are based on the Titanic dataset.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to practice and demonstrate core Pandas functionalities, including data cleaning, selection, manipulation, and statistical analysis.

## Notebooks Description

The following notebooks cover specific topics and operations:

| Notebook | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **[Edit_dataset.ipynb](Edit_dataset.ipynb)** | Covers renaming columns, type casting (e.g., converting to boolean), and applying functions using `apply()` and lambda expressions. |
| **[Save_file.ipynb](Save_file.ipynb)** | Demonstrates handling missing values by dropping nulls (`dropna()`) and saving the cleaned DataFrame to a new CSV file. |
| **[Sorting.ipynb](Sorting.ipynb)** | Explores methods for sorting DataFrames, such as `sort_values()`. |
| **[data_selection.ipynb](data_selection.ipynb)** | Focuses on accessing data: selecting specific columns, creating DataFrames from lists, and using `iloc` and `loc` for row selection. |
| **[intermanuplation.ipynb](intermanuplation.ipynb)** | Demonstrates techniques for handling missing data, specifically using interpolation (`interpolate()`) to fill null values. |
| **[mathmathical_opr.ipynb](mathmathical_opr.ipynb)** | performs basic statistical operations on DataFrame columns, such as `count()`, `mean()`, `max()`, `min()`, and `std()`. |

## Files
- `Titanic-Dataset.csv`: The primary dataset used for these exercises.
- `update.csv`: A processed version of the dataset (generated by `Save_file.ipynb`).

## Prerequisites

To run these notebooks, you will need:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

- NumPy library (`pip install numpy`)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Open any `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook to view or run the code.

```bash
jupyter notebook
